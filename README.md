# Machine-learning-image-compression-with-PCA

- ### Use PCA to compress the image
-  ### This practice fulfills the following requirements:
    1. Load the 5 images and plot them. Make sure the name of the file is displayed on the title of the relevant image.

    2. Set up a pipeline that scales the values linearly between 0 and 1 and applies PCA such that 5 images from different wavelengths are combined to 1 channel data. 

    3. Report the number of features and the number of samples.

    4. What are the PCA directions?

    5. What is the explained variance ratio when using only this 1 image?

    6. What is the value of the last pixel in the new image? 
    Display the new image.
